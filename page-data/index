<h2>Open source comes to campus</h2>

<p>We're free software enthusiasts.</p>

<p>We want U Penn students to have the community knowledge and technical skills to participate in
globally distributed software projects: Big ones, like
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> and 
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and small ones, like
<a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/">PyBlosxom</a> and
<a href="http://rephial.org/">angband</a>.</p>

<p>Does that sound cool? We'll teach you.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
<h2>Small-group learning</h2>

<p>On <strong>Saturday, Sep 25</strong>, we'll teach 25 U Penn students.</p>

<p>We'll <strong>feed you lunch</strong> and give you hands-on sessions where you learn
about open source licensing, collaboration tools, and how free software projects
are organized.</p>

<p>Space is limited, so we'll focus on people with a real interest in learning.</p>

<p class="doit">You should really <a href="signup/">sign up</a>.</p>

<h2>Build things</h2>

<p>On <strong>Sunday, Sep 26</strong>, we invite you to an
open "hack" session. ("Hacking" is a good thing!)</p>

<p>If you're not sure what to work on, we'll step you through
how to modify programs like Firefox and the GIMP image editor
and help you find a project idea.</p>

<p>We'll have community members representing a bunch of
open source projects hanging around, helping out. And
we'll <strong>feed you lunch</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why do it?</h2>

<p>You should sign up because open source <em>is</em> the real world.
If you become part of the community, you can collaborate with people
as close as 34th Street and as far as Australia on software projects
people actually use.</p>

<p class="doit">Learn more about <a href="why/">why you should sign up</a>.</p>

<h2>Supported and sponsored by the community</h2>

<p>
This hackathon is co-organized by the <a href="http://dp.seas.upenn.edu/index.html">U Penn Dining Philosophers</a>,
Yuvi Masory, and OpenHatch. Learn more about us and
