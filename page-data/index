<h2>Open source comes to campus</h2>

<p>We're free software enthusiasts.</p>

<p>We want U Penn students to have the community knowledge and technical skills to participate in
globally distributed software projects: Big ones, like Firefox and WordPress, and small ones, like
PyBlosxom and angband.</p>

<p>Does that sound cool? We'll teach you.</p>
