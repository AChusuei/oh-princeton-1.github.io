<h2>Why do it?</h2>

<p>Open source software like Linux and Firefox are used by hundreds of millions of people.
This event is the fast track to participating.</p>

<p>If you come out on Saturday, we'll teach you how the community works. You'll get to play with
essential tools like version control and IRC chat.</p>

<h2>You want me to go to class on Saturday?</h2>

<p>It's not really <em>class</em>. For half an hour, five students and one teacher will discuss
a particular topic, like how projects collaborate using bug trackers. Then you get to
<strong>try things out</strong> on your own computer. Then onto the next topic.</p>

<h2>Can anyone sign up?</h2>

<p>You have to be a student at a Philadelphia-area college or university to attend. (If you want to run a similar event
at a different college, email us at <strong>penn@openhatch.org</strong>.)</p>

<p>On Saturday, we only have room for 25 people. We're looking for people who like technical crafts that
scale well across the Internet. That usually means software programming, user interface design,
technical writing, and testing. And we're looking for people who are enthusiastic!</p>

<h2>So sign up</h2>

<p>All you have to do to sign up is email <strong>penn@openhatch.org</strong> with this information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>One sentence about how you discovered this website</li>
<li>One sentence about your involvement in open source (e.g., "never heard of it", "run Ubuntu", "wrote most of the Linux kernel")</li>
<li>One sentence of something you're excited about learning</li>
</ul>
